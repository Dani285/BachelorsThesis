	The project is about creating a machine learning algorithm that can understand words from recording. To do that, we need to build a model that will calculate the accuracy of words from the recording. To build a model and calculate the model we needed to extract data from the voice and store it, after storing all the data we will create the model. In order to make sure the model understanding words we will test it with real life recording. All recordings are from the database Modzilla Common Voice.

		\section{Introduction}
		The goal of this project is to build an algorithm that is capable of understanding sentences from different recordings. To build the model we extract the data from recording and use that data to calculate the accuracy of that model. 
		\subsection{What is Machine Learning}
		Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, which is broadly defined as the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior. Artificial intelligence systems are used to perform complex tasks in a way that is similar to how humans solve problems.
		Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to enable computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. The learning process is automated and improved based on the experiences of the machines throughout the process.
		\subsection{History of Machine Learning}
		1642 - Blaise Pascal created one of the first mechanical adding machines as an attempt to automate data processing. It employed a mechanism of cogs and wheels, similar to those in odometers and other counting devices.\\
		1801 - When looking at the history of machine learning, there are lots of surprises. Our first encounter was a data storage device. Believe it or not, the first data storage device was, in fact, a weaving loom. The first use of data storage was in a loom created by a French inventor named Joseph-Marie Jacquard, that used metal cards with holes to arrange threads. These cards comprised a program to control the loom and allowed a procedure to be repeated with the same outcome every time.\\
		1847 - Boolean Logic (also known as Boolean Algebra), all values are either True or False. These true and false values are employed to check the conditions that selection and iteration rely on. This is how Boolean operators work. George Boole created AND, OR, and NOR operators using this logic, responding to questions about true or false, yes or no, and binary 1s and 0s. These operators are still used in web searches today.
		Boolean algebra is introduced in artificial intelligence to address some of the problems associated with machine learning.\\
		1890 - Herman Hollerith developed the first combined mechanical calculation and punch-card system to compute statistics from millions of individuals efficiently. It was an electromechanical machine built to assist in summarizing data stored on punched cards.\\
		1949 - In 1949, Canadian psychologist Donald O. Hebb, then a lecturer at McGill University, published The Organization of Behavior: A Neuropsychological Theory. Hebb referred to the combination of neurons that may be regarded as a single processing unit as “cell assemblies.”
		Hebb’s model for the functioning of the mind has had a significant influence on how psychologists view stimulus processing in mind. It also paved the way for the development of computational machines that replicated natural neurological processes, such as machine learning.\\
		1950 - In 1950 Alan Turing created the Turing Test to determine if a computer has real intelligence. To pass the test, a computer must be able to fool a human into believing it is also human.
		\section{Support Vector Machines(SVM)}
		A support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning model that uses classification algorithms for two-group classification problems. After giving an SVM model sets of labeled training data for each category, they’re able to categorize new text. Compared to newer algorithms like neural networks, they have two main advantages: higher speed and better performance with a limited number of samples (in the thousands).
		The goal is to find the hyperline in a N-dimensional space.(N - number of features). To separate the data points need to choose the best hyperplanes which has the maximum distance between data points of both classes.(Distance between points - Maximum margin). The data points falling on both sides of the hyperplanes, and the dimension of hyperplanes depends upon the number of features. However the number of input features is only 2 then the hyperplane is just a line. When we going up with the number of input features the hyperplane becomes two-dimensional.
		\subsection{SVM overview}
		The support vectors are data points that are closer to the hyperplanes and manipulate the orientation of the hyperplanes. Using support vectors we set the maximum margin of the classifier.
		SVM can be used both on regression and classification, but mainly used in classification objectives.
		\subsection{SVM implementations}
		In SVM algorithm we are looking to maximaze the margin between data points and the hyperplanes. To do that we actually need to calculate the loss function, which will help us to determine the maximum margin.

		\section{Sound Processing}
		
		\subsection{Java Sound Processing}
		
		\subsection{Examples of sound processing}
		
		\section{Sound Format}
		Sound Format defines the  quantity and loss of audio data.
		They are divided into 3 parts:Uncompressed Formats,	Lossy Compressed format,Lossless Compressed Format.
		\\
		Uncompressed file formats are :
		\begin{itemize}
		\item PCM
		\item WAV 
		\item and AIFF
		\end{itemize}
		Lossy compressed formats are : 
		\begin{itemize}
		\item MP3
		\item AAC
		\item WMA
		\end{itemize}
		Lossless compressed formats are
		\begin{itemize}
		\item FLAC
		\item ALAC.
		\end{itemize}
		
		\subsection{Sound File Formats}
		Sound file formats are digital standards for storing audio information. PCM needs to be organized into a file so you can work with it, or play it back in a system. Different audio file formats use differents containers and varying methods of data compression to organize the PCM stream. Depending on which you choose, each format represents the same information in different storage sizes or quality.\\
		PCM(Pulse Code Modulation) - Represents raw audio signals in digital forms. To convert analog signal into digital it has to be at different interval. It has sampling rate and bitrate,bits use to represent each sample in the audio.\\
		WAV(WaveForm Audio File Format) - It was developed by Microsoft and IBM. It's a windows audio format. it's just a wrapper most cases these WAV files contains uncompressed audio in PCM format.\\
		AIFF(Audio Interchange File Format) - Developed by Apple for mac.
		They can obtain multiple kinds of audio format. This format is also a wrapper for PCM encoding. Containing uncompressed audio in PCM format. Compatibility both for Windows and Mac systems.
		
		\section{Discrete Fourier Transform}
		The Discrete Fourier Tranform(DFT) is considered one of the most used algorithm of all the time. It's used in digital communication, image compression, signal processing etc. Fourier transform on such discrete signals can be done using DFT, which can be used to switch back and forth between the time and frequency domains.
		\subsection{Discrete Fourier Transform theory and implementation}
		
		\section{Learning Database, history, size types of words, methods of collection}
		
		\section{Mozilla spoken words project}
		Mozilla Common Voice is a free database that's help build voice data for speech recognition. The project supported by valunteers worldwide, they are record their voices and sentences, also they review other peoples recordings. These recorded sentences are collected in a voice database so everybody can access to the voices.
		\subsection{Modzilla Common Voice database recordings}
		
		\section{Number of samples, and the types of recorded words}
		
		\section{SWIG}
		SWIG is a software development tool that simplifies the task of interfacing different languages to C and C++ programs. In a nutshell, SWIG is a compiler that takes C/C++ declarations and creates the wrappers needed to access those declarations from other languages including Perl, Python, Tcl, Ruby, Guile, and Java. SWIG was originally designed to make it extremely easy for scientists and engineers to build extensible scientific software without having to write complicated code.
		\subsection{Why use SWIG}
		Using SWIG, you can replace the main() function of a C program with a scripting interpreter from which you can control the application. SWIG allows C/C++ programs to be placed in a scripting environment that can be used for testing and debugging.
		\subsection{Examples of using SWIG}
		
		\section{Java and its modules}
		
		\section{Java machine learning libraries}
		
		\subsection{Weka,Deeplearning4j,JavaML,OpenNLP}
		
		\section{DLib library for machine learning}
		
		\subsection{Dlib implementation}
		
		\section{Searching for machine learning libraries}
		
		\subsection{Finding the library for machine learning}
		First we needed to find the best library for us to create the model.
		We started by looking in the web for a unique library that will do this task for us. We found lot of that which is compatible with Java, but not all libraries were right for that task. To make sure we use the right library we did some research about Weka ML and Dlib ML.
		Sooner or later we realized that for us the best pick is Dlib ML. It's support lot of langues and with a right wrapper we can implement that to make the algorithm for model.
		\subsection{Choosing the right library for machine learning}
		To choose the best machine learning library for this task was quite diffucult, because we had so many options sin Java. We started with Weka which is a machine learning library for Java, but later we realized that just doesn't fit there.
